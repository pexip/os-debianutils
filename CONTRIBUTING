# CONTRIBUTING

Contributions to debianutils should conform with the
mission, vision, and values, documentation of which
is a work in progress.

# SCOPE

debianutils is meant to provide small utilities that
are used primarily by the installation scripts of Debian
packages in order to address needs that cannot be
fulfilled by other packages.

For historical reasons, there are utilities in
debianutils that should not be there.  For example,
`savelog` is superfluous given the existence of
the far superior `logrotate`.  Therefore, in the
long term, `savelog` should be deprecated and removed.

# TIERS

Accordingly, some included utilities are considered
second-class and will receive minimal-to-no support.
If your objective is to add features to any of the
following, the preferred course of action is to fork
them and coordinate their removals from debianutils:

* ischroot
* savelog
* which
